2	Business Concept

2.1	Business Idea
My business idea is a shopping website that allows users to put
 up kickboxing boxing gear for sale and allows other users to view and purchase these products.


2.2	Business model 
The business will make money by advertising on the website
while also taking 10% of the cost of an item when an item is sold on the website.


2.3	Market Research
Market for Product/Service
The target market consists of people of all ages who kickbox. They will buy products as they are cheaper than buying brand new products from other sources.
 I think there is definitely a big enough market to support and sustain this product for a long time.

 Customers - Demographics, Profile
 The service focuses on people who train at kickboxing and who need new training gear,
  whether they are beginners, amateurs, or fighters.

2.4	Marketing/Advertising

2.5	Suppliers

2.6	Competitors
Competitors in the same space are sites like ebay,amazon or craigslist. Weaknesses of these competitors is that they are not specific to  used Muay Thai Training gear. They sell a more larger base of products at higher costs. 
These sites all allow users to put products up for sale and allows them to purchase products.

3	Requirements 

3.1	Introduction

My software project is a web application/website which allows users to sell and purchase
2nd hand kickboxing gear. This application may be used when for someone wants to purchase 
2nd hand training gear or when someone would like to sell on old training gear they no longer use.
For example, a customer may be an individual who has just started training at kickboxing and would like to have their own gear to use in training, rather than using the gyms gear. With this application, the customer can purchase high quality second hand gear for a low price, as oppose to buying premium gear first hand, when they are still a beginner to the sport. Applications similar to this are websites like ebay, amazon or size.ie. All of these websites allow users to buy second items and allows users to list items up for sale on the site. With this application, those who kickbox will now have an alternative place to buy their gear for lower prices and a place to sell on their unused kickboxing gear.


You can write a bit about your project area.  Each paragraph has a blank line between it and the previous paragraph


3.2	Requirements gathering

3.2.1	Similar applications
Look at and document 2 similar applications.  Be sure to include the following for each:
o	Screen shots
o	Descriptions
o	Advantages
o	Disadvantages

3.2.2	Interviews
Conduct interviews with 2 or 3 users to find out what the important features for them for the app are.  There may be various issues that arise in multiple interviews. These can be grouped together into a number of themes.

3.3.2	Non-functional requirements
These are requirements which if not met do not stop the application from working, but which mean that the application is not working as well as it should.  They are usually based on issues such as:
•	Basket function
•	Wishlist function
•	Favorites function 
•	Maintainability

3.3.3	Use Case Diagrams
Consists of actors and use cases.  You should document each individual use case.

Delete the following diagram and insert your diagram.  Use draw.io

5	Database Design 
5.1	Description
A company has a website that sells video games for different consoles. They would need a database for all their games and order places. For each order place, they would need games bought, total price, date of the order, and how long it will take to deliver. The database needs to keep track of all games that are being sold. Customers will have to input their information when registering an account. Customers will also have to input their card details when making a payment for their order. 
5.2	Business Reporting Requirements

3.	Users may want to find a festival by a specific start date.
4.	Users need to find all festivals using a list of genres.
5.	Users need to find the stage for a specific show.

8.	Users need to find festivals by location and the location needs to be displayed on a Google Map
9.	User may need to find festivals by city
10.	Users need to find stages within a festival by the stage’s location
11.	Organisers need to display a list of employees that are assigned to a specific festival

7	Testing 
7.1	Introduction

This chapter describes the testing that has been undertaken for the application. This chapter is presented in two sections:

1.	Functional Testing
2.	User Testing

Functional testing is a type of software testing whereby the system is tested against the functional requirements.  The app is tested by looking to see if the actual output for a given input corresponds with the expected output.  The tests should be based on the requirements for the app.  The results of functional testing can indicate if a piece of software is functional and working, but not if the software is easy to use.

User testing looks to see if a piece of software is easy and intuitive for the user.


7.2	Functional Testing

This section describes the functional tests which were carried out on the app.  These functional tests can be categorised as: (whatever is relevant to your app)

Login/Registration
Navigation
Calculation
CRUD 

Functional testing generally uses a Black Box Testing technique which means that the internal logic of the system being tested is not of interest to the tester.  The tester is only interested in whether the actual output agrees with the expected output.


7.2.1	Login/Registration
