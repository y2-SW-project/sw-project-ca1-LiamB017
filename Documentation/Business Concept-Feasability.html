2	Business Concept

2.1	Business Idea
My business idea is a shopping website that allows users to put
 up kickboxing boxing gear for sale and allows other users to view and purchase these products.


2.2	Business model 
The business will make money by advertising on the website
while also taking 10% of the cost of an item when an item is sold on the website.


2.3	Market Research
Market for Product/Service
The target market consists of people of all ages who kickbox. They will buy products as they are cheaper than buying brand new products from other sources.
 I think there is definitely a big enough market to support and sustain this product for a long time.

 Customers - Demographics, Profile
 The service focuses on people who train at kickboxing and who need new training gear,
  whether they are beginners, amateurs, or fighters.

2.4	Marketing/Advertising

2.5	Suppliers

2.6	Competitors
Competitors in the same space are sites like ebay,amazon or craigslist. Weaknesses of these competitors is that they are not specific to  used Muay Thai Training gear. They sell a more larger base of products at higher costs. 
These sites all allow users to put products up for sale and allows them to purchase products.

2.7	Employees

2.8	Environmental Impact


 
3	Requirements 

3.1	Introduction

The purpose of the requirements phase is to allow for developers to work out what the application should be able to do. It is important to understand what the users would like the application to do rather than the developer deciding what is required.

You can write a bit about your project area.  Each paragraph has a blank line between it and the previous paragraph


3.2	Requirements gathering

3.2.1	Similar applications
Look at and document 2 similar applications.  Be sure to include the following for each:
o	Screen shots
o	Descriptions
o	Advantages
o	Disadvantages

3.2.2	Interviews
Conduct interviews with 2 or 3 users to find out what the important features for them for the app are.  There may be various issues that arise in multiple interviews. These can be grouped together into a number of themes.

3.3	Requirements modelling
3.3.1	Functional requirements
Create a numbered list of what the application should be able to do. Start with the most important feature.

3.3.2	Non-functional requirements
These are requirements which if not met do not stop the application from working, but which mean that the application is not working as well as it should.  They are usually based on issues such as:
o	Usability
o	Performance 
o	Security

3.3.3	Use Case Diagrams
Consists of actors and use cases.  You should document each individual use case.

Delete the following diagram and insert your diagram.  Use draw.io
 

3.4	Feasibility

This section describes which technologies are planned to be used in the development of the application.  It then explains if there are any issues in terms of the technical feasibility of the project, for example, if there are two different types of software which may have compatibility issues. 
4	Web application Design
4.1	Layout
Describe the layout  of your web application. Does this depend on a framework like bootstrap? Is it repsonsive?
4.2	Interaction
What are the navigation elements, form elements. How does the user interact with the application?
4.3	Colour schemes
Describe the colour palette that you will use consistently across the web application

4.4	Font choices
Specify the fonts that you will use for different types of text. Include samples for paragraph text, headings and bold and italicised text.

4.5	Wireframes
Describe how to navigate from one page to the next by adding an diagram of the different screens and what the main functionality is.

 


 
5	Database Design 
5.1	Description
A company has a website that sells video games for different consoles. They would need a database for all their games and order places. For each order place, they would need games bought, total price, date of the order, and how long it will take to deliver. The database needs to keep track of all games that are being sold. Customers will have to input their information when registering an account. Customers will also have to input their card details when making a payment for their order. 
5.2	Business Reporting Requirements
Substitute in here the information the users of your application will want to be able to view.
1.	Organisers need to be able to create, read, update, and delete: festivals, stages, shows, performers, and genres.
2.	Users will need to be able to find all festivals ordered by their start date.
3.	Users may want to find a festival by a specific start date.
4.	Users need to find all festivals using a list of genres.
5.	Users need to find the stage for a specific show.
6.	Users need to find the shows using a performers name.
7.	Performers may need to find the list of festival contacts.
8.	Users need to find festivals by location and the location needs to be displayed on a Google Map
9.	User may need to find festivals by city
10.	Users need to find stages within a festival by the stage’s location
11.	Organisers need to display a list of employees that are assigned to a specific festival


5.3	Textual Representation of Data-Set
Substitute in here the tables for your database

FESTIVAL (title, description, latitude, longitude, city, start_date, end_date, image_id)
PERFORMER (title, description, contact_email, contact_phone, image_id)
GENRE (title, description)
IMAGE (id, filename)
SHOW (date, start_time, end_time, performer_id, stage_id)
STAGE (title, description, location, festival_id, image_id)
GENRE_PERFORMER (id, genre_id, performer_id)
EMPLOYEE (name, phone, email)
FESTIVAL_EMPLOYEE (employee_id, festival_id, role)
 
5.4	Business Rules
Substitute in here the business rules for your database
•      A Festival has many Stages.
•      A Stage belongs to one Festival.
•      A Stage hosts many Shows.
•      A Show is performed on one Stage.
•      A Performer can perform in many Shows.
•      A Show is performed by one Performer.
•      A Performer can have many Genres.
•      A Genre can belong to many Performers.
•      A Performer can have a single Image.
•      A Festival can have a single Image.
•      A Stage can have a single Image.
•      An Image can be associated with a Performer, Festival, or Stage
•      A Festival can have many Employees associated with it
•      An Employee can be assigned to one Festival at a time

5.5	Entity Relationship Diagram
Substitute in here your ERD from draw.io
 
5.6	Tables
Substitute in here your tables and the relationships between tables from draw.io in the format you used in DBMS with Mohammed.

7	Testing 
7.1	Introduction

This chapter describes the testing that has been undertaken for the application. This chapter is presented in two sections:

1.	Functional Testing
2.	User Testing

Functional testing is a type of software testing whereby the system is tested against the functional requirements.  The app is tested by looking to see if the actual output for a given input corresponds with the expected output.  The tests should be based on the requirements for the app.  The results of functional testing can indicate if a piece of software is functional and working, but not if the software is easy to use.

User testing looks to see if a piece of software is easy and intuitive for the user.


7.2	Functional Testing

This section describes the functional tests which were carried out on the app.  These functional tests can be categorised as: (whatever is relevant to your app)

Login/Registration
Navigation
Calculation
CRUD 

Functional testing generally uses a Black Box Testing technique which means that the internal logic of the system being tested is not of interest to the tester.  The tester is only interested in whether the actual output agrees with the expected output.


7.2.1	Login/Registration
